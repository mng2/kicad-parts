Schematic symbol for HP 8566A/8566B rear panel Centronics connector

CSV formatted for use with KiPart. The current version of KiPart
seems to assume that the ordering of pins should be counterclockwise;
so using the -s row option or -s num option didn't give me the desired
result. I flipped the rows for pins 1-25 in LibreOffice, and used
-s row to get the correct representation.
